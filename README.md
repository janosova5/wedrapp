# wedrapp
iOS app for the weather forecast

### What the app can do

By default the app shows the current weather on an user's current location.
User can see also the 5 days forecast, which is displayed for every 3 hours.
If an user wants to see the weather on another location, he can type the name of the city in the search field. 
When clicked on search field, the background is filled with the European metropoles weather. An user can click on some of them to see more or can continue to type his own location. 
The left navigation bar button on home screen enables an user to refresh the location with his current location.

### Some tech stuff

The app architecture uses the MVVM architecture pattern.
The app uses the Cocoapods - Alamofire and ObjectMapper for the request mapping and ReactiveCocoa for the code to be reactive.
